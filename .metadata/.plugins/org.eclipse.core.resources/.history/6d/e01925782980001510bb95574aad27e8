This file is the introduction of HashIndex and how it works. 

In this project, static Hashtable is used to store value under given datavalue which is the index, 
this program could also get and remove the keylist of the datavalue(index) we put in.

Testing method and how to use:
Once the program starts to run, the following is printed first:
Database file exist !
Test line of Hash Index!!
then our program read data from the already exist file cs542.txt automatically and put them in the Hashtable,
you will see "Put key into index succeed"when the hash function successfully put a key in the Hashtable.
after reading and putting all the data from the ".txt" file, the program begin to test the "GET" function of the Hashtable.
with different type of input, the test result is different ,when you provide our get function just the number year, 
our program will show the movies of that year regardless of the type of that movie, when you give more specific condition like year and type, 
our program will show the movies fit for that condition. if you enter some datavalude which has no matched key in our hashtable, 
our program will show "Key not Found"
after all these work done our program will show "Job Done"
